# edu-http-server

## For those stumbling here:
This is a presonal project in which Iâ€¯program a minimal HTTP server. It is only intended to be educational.

## Objectives:

### A - Answering a single get request

The program must be able to listen on a given port, receive a get request (lets say for an index.html page), and respond correctly.
That means:
1 - Having a way to receive data through the network, and store it somewhere. <===
